# micp_hilti

The following instructions explain how MICP-L accuracy was evaluated on Hilti Datasets. All evaluations were done on a CPU only part of MICP-L.

## System Requirements

We tested these scripts on:
- Ubuntu 20.04
- ROS noetic
- AMD Ryzen 7

## Download

Download/Clone this package anywhere in your system. Proceed with next step.

## Dependencies

Put the following dependencies in your ROS-workspace:

### RMCL

- Link: https://github.com/uos/rmcl
- Branch: main


### pointcloud_motion_deskew

Since MICP-L does not interpolate between start and end of a scan we use this package to compensate for that.

- Branch: melodic

### amock_tools

Some tools for tf-preprocessing of Hilti Bags. Move from "packages" folder to your workspace.

### Optional: Mesh visualization with rmagine_ros and mesh_tools

For visualization of the mesh map in RViz

- Branch: main
